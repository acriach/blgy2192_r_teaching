# This is R

## Opening R through Notable

Go to the Minerva site for BLGY2192 and the `Learning R` folder. Click on `Notable Copmputational Notebooks` (similar to Apps Anywhere).  
Under `Please select a personal notebook server` make sure `RStudio` is chosen.

<br>

**Tip: Using R after this session**
:::

When using a university computer in a cluster, use R and RStudio through AppsAnywhere. 

* Click the AppsAnywhere icon, scroll down to "Cran R" and click launch. 
* Once R has opened and downloaded onto the computer you can close it. 
* Now go back into Apps Anywhere to find RStudio and launch that.

<br>

If you only downloaded RStudio onto your computer it would not work. RStudio needs R installed to make it work.  

You can try to download R and RStudio onto your own laptop in your own time using these links.

<kbd>[Download and install the latest version of R](https://www.r-project.org/)</kbd>  

<kbd>[Download and install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)</kbd>

<br>

## Basic Layout

When you first open RStudio, you will see three panels:

  * The interactive R console (left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="A screenshot of Rstudio showing eleven menus at the top left. One panel covers the left half with text about the R software. The right is divided into two panels with text saying that the environment is empty in the top panel and a display of the current file directory in the bottom panel."}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/RStudio_screenshot.png")
```

Once you open files, such as R scripts another panel will open in the top left.

* Click on the white square with the plus in green icon top left.

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Two zoomed in screenshots of the top left menus in RStudio. The first screenshot shows a black rectangle highlighting an icon which is a white square with a plus inside a green circle. The second screenshot shows a black rectangle highlighting a menu item that reads R Script followed by the associated keyboard shortcut, Ctrl + Shift + N."}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/RStudio_screenshot_script.png")

```

R works by you typing commands, telling R to run them, and then R returns a result.  

All the commands we type in the .R file script can be saved for later and run again in R.

<br>

## Working in a script

The simplest thing you can do with R is use it as a calculator. Type the below into the script we just opened:

```{r}
1 + 100
```

Now run the code in R by pressing the Run command at the top left of the script window.

<br>

:::: {.darkorchidbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Tip: Running segments of your code**
:::

To run a line of your script code in the R console, you can  
1. click on the <kbd>Run</kbd> button at the top right of the script, or  
2. hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Windows or Linux or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> on MacOS.  
To run a block of code, select it and then <kbd>Run</kbd>.
::::

<br>

R will print out the answer, with a preceding `[1]`. Don't worry about this. Think of it as merely indicating what line the output is on.

<br>

If you type in an incomplete command, for example: 

~~~
> 1 +
~~~

R will show a `+` instead of a `>`. This means it's waiting for you to complete the command.  

If you want to cancel the command you can hit "Esc" and RStudio will give you back the ">" prompt.

<br>

## Functions

R has many built in functions (similar to excel functions). To call a function,
we can type its name, followed by brackets.
Anything we type inside the brackets is called the function's
arguments:

```{r}
log(15)  # natural logarithm
```
The text after each line of code is called a “comment”. Anything that follows after the hash symbol # is ignored by R when it executes code.

```{r}
sqrt(25) # square root
```

<br>

**Tip**
:::

Don't worry about trying to remember every function in R. You
can Google them, or if you can remember the
start of a function's name, use the tab completion in RStudio.
::::

<br>

We can also do comparisons in R:

```{r}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")
```

```{r}
1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")
```

```{r}
1 >= -9 # greater than or equal to
```

<br>

## Objects and assignment

We can store values in **objects** using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:

```{r}
x <- 1/40
```

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored the number for later
in the object `x`. `x` now contains the **value** `0.025`:

```{r}
x
```


<br>

Look for the `Environment` tab in one of the panes of RStudio, and you will see that `x` and its value
have appeared. Our object `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:

```{r}
log(x)
```

Objects can be reassigned:

```{r}
x <- 100
```

`x` used to contain the value 0.025 and now it has the value 100.

Assignment values can contain the object being assigned to:

```{r}
x <- x + 1 # notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

<br>

Object names are not limited to `x` and `y`. They can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They must start with a letter. They
cannot start with a number, underscore nor contain spaces at all. Different people use
different conventions for long variable names, these include

  * periods.between.words
  * underscores\_between_words
  * camelCaseToSeparateWords

What you use is up to you, but **be consistent**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="A wound up snake with mouth open is beside the screaming_snake_case. A spread out snake has snake_case written on it. A camel with headphones on has camelCase written on it with the captial C in the space of it's hump. Colourful letters on a line spell out kebab-case"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/coding_cases.png")
```

<br>


One thing to be aware of is that R is *vectorized*, meaning that
objects and functions can have vectors as values. In contrast to physics and
mathematics, a vector in R describes a set of values in a certain order of the
same data type. For example:

```{r}
1:5
```

Assign this vector to the object `x`
```{r}
x <- 1:5
```

This is incredibly powerful as you will see:
```{r}
log(x)
```

```{r ch2pt1-sol}
mass <- 40
```
This will give a value of `r mass` for the object mass

```{r ch2pt2-sol}
age <- 122
```
This will give a value of `r age` for the object age
```{r ch2pt3-sol}
mass <- mass * 2
```
This will multiply the existing value of `r mass/2` by 2 to give a new value of
`r mass` to the object mass.

```{r ch2pt4-sol}
age <- age - 20
```
This will subtract 20 from the existing value of `r age + 20 ` to give a new value of `r age` to the object age.

<details>
  <summary>**Solution**</summary>

One way of answering this question in R is to use the `>` to set up the following:
```{r ch3-sol}
mass > age
```
This should yield a boolean value of FALSE since `r mass` is not greater than `r age`.

## More on how functions work

There are lots of useful commands you can use to interact with the R session.

`ls` will list all of the objects and functions stored in the global environment
(your working R session):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ls()
```

Note here that we didn't give any arguments to `ls`, but we still
needed to give the parentheses to tell R to call the function.

If we type `ls` by itself, R prints a bunch of code instead of listing objects.

```{r}
ls
```

What's going on here?
Like everything in R, `ls` is the name of an object, and entering the name of an object by itself prints the contents of the object. 

The object `x` that we created earlier contains 1,2,3,4,5:
```{r}
x
```

The object `ls` contains the R code that makes the `ls` function work!

<br>

`rm` deletes objects you no longer need:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(x)
```

If you have lots of things in your environment and want to delete all of them,
you can **pass** the results of `ls` through the `rm` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

Here we've combined two functions. Like the order of maths operations, anything
inside the innermost parentheses is evaluated first, and so on.

In this case we've specified that the results of `ls` should be used for the
`list` argument in `rm`. 

Note: When assigning values to arguments by name, you use the `=` operator.

If instead we use `<-`, there will be unintended side effects, or you may get an error message:

```{r, error=TRUE}
rm(list <- ls())
```

<br>

**Tip: Warnings vs. Errors**
:::

Errors, like above, are thrown when R cannot proceed with a calculation. Warnings on the other hand usually mean that the function has run, but it probably hasn't worked as expected.  

In both cases, the message that R prints out can give you clues on how to fix a problem.

## R Packages

It is possible to add functions to R by
installing a package written by someone else (or by writing your own package!) As of this writing, there
are over 18,000 packages available on CRAN (the comprehensive R archive
network). 

Notable already has lots of packages installed ready for you to use. The package tab is where the packages already installed are listed.

:::: {.darkorchidbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Tip: Installing packages**
:::

To install a package when using R on your own computer either:

* Type `install.packages("packagename")`,
  where `packagename` is the package name in quotes.
* Or, under the **Packages** tab, click **Install** and type the name of the package.

Installing a package only needs doing once unless you change the computer you are working on. 

::::


<br>

Once a package is installed, it needs to be `library` loaded  before you can use it.

You can load a package and make it available for use with `library(packagename)`. Load the packages `ggplot2`, `penguins`

```{r ch5-sol, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(penguins)
```

Move these lines of code to the top of your script since this is where coders put them.
